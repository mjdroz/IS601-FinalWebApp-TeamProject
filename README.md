## Project Concept
* The overall concept of this project is to view cities from around the world. The user will be able to view cities from countries across the globe, edit the data for those cities, add new cities to the list, and delete an entry.
* **The additional features that we have added are:**
    * A login and registration system where users can create new accounts for the website. This feature uses email verification, and user who do not verify their email will not be allowed to login.
    * A profile page where users can view their profile information such as their username and email, change their profile information, and change their password.
